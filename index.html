        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>
            Terry Pratchett is one of the most popular science fiction authors in
            Great Britain. He has written many works framed in this genre: novels,
            short stories, scripts, among others. Meanwhile, it has been the series
            entitled Mundodisco the most famous and successful written by this
            writer who is on his heels of sales to J. K. Rowling (Harry Potter).
            Terence David John "Terry" Pratchett, such as his full name, is a native
            of the English county of Buckinghamshire, where he was born on April 28,
            1948. From an early age he showed inclinations for writing. At the age
            of thirteen he had already written his first story that was published
            almost immediately because of the interest he aroused. Incursion into
            journalism Interested in writing, he decided to study journalism. He
            worked in several newspapers such as: Bucks Free Press, Western Daily,
            and Bath Chronicle, in which, in addition to executive positions, he
            published his stories. Disco world, a hyper-tastic saga that popularized
            it Discworld or Discworld is his most popular work. It consists of a
            saga composed of several novels that narrate the adventures in a
            hyper-fantastic and flat world that holds elephants and that is held in
            the shell of a turtle. Recognitions in your homeland The recognition of
            his homeland for his enormous contribution to literature fortunately
            came to him in life and so in 1998 he received the Most Excellent Order
            of the British Empire (OBE), a distinction that corresponds to the order
            of cavalry and that has been for centuries the most outstanding that the
            British crown delivers through his monarch to those who make a
            fundamental contribution to the culture of his homeland, Unfortunately,
            at an early age, in 2007, he was declared Alzheimer's disease and then
            his health begins to gradually suffer. He died on March 12, 2015. He was
            married and had a daughter who is also dedicated to writing like his
            father.
